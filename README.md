# Predicting Movie Theater Gross with CDC Vaccination Data

The goal of this project was to attempt to predict the domestic gross of movies using primarily release date features and how they interacted with vaccination data for Covid-19. This was attempted through a linear regression model, using regularization models such as LASSO to even out features and decrease overfitting. Despite the use of LASSO, the model is overfitting the data and further exploration of regression methods such as time series should be explored.
