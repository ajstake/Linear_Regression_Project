# Initial Findings

My initial findings show that there is definitely some kind of relationship that trends towards positive between the gross of a movie to date and the number of completely vaccinated people. This initial pairplot also shows a great deal of noise in the data as well as no categorical features such as if a movie was a rerelease during its time, so there is still much to be done.
